Route21 in its self is a very unique charity and well ahead of its time in terms of the area it targets, so in this project 
we tried using new and popular apps and websites in order to make out final project more interactive and user friendly.
As we have a demograph of 16 to 21, we first started by splitting the age groups into three, 14 to 16(GCSE), 16 to 18(A-Level) and 
18 to 21(Further education). The reason for this was because different age groups will need to be addressed differently,
by splitting them up we will be able to generate different files depending on age and depending on what might be available for them. 

The platform we decided to use was website form which would be accessible thought the phone or even on a laptop/desktop, this makes it
easy to get to and use as majority of our target market would be of a younger generation who would of grown up in a fairly technological 
world. Due to this we focused on a lot on just be easy to manage and fast.

What makes us different?
We do not want young people to be going out of their way to search like most traditional websites, but instead we want to be able to gatherinformation though gathering information on the individual so that we can make it as flexible and dynamic as possible for them. This
would be done by using keywords to compare what their interests are and what submitters are looking for, by this we can then 
generate links for them to view and decide for themselves. We also aim to make it easy for young people and submitters to be able to 
communicate using a chat system so that replies can feel more genuine and not so much as if you are talking to a robot.

Step 1:
We created a simple login page/sign up page, where people are able to choice what kind of account they make. 
This means that people looking for submitters could be separated depending on their age where they can browse and search 
for upcoming events or jobs. While submitters that would like to use the site to advertise could make a separate account 
where they can advertise what they are offering.

Step 2:
young people once they are logged in via Facebook or generic email sign up will be directed to a home page, where they are given 
the opportunity to branch out though messaging, sharing or searching using key words. This gives them the ability to explore 
options that they may never have thought of. They are then given the chance to search though submitters and swipe left or 
right depending on what they found to best suited to them.

Step 3:
Once young people have done their research, it will then be up to submitters to make the next step.If the submitters match with user, 
we will be creating a link between them, this makes an opportunity for the young people to then dive deeper by being allowed to have 
more access to information on the submitters (requirements, job description, contact details, submittersâ€™ website and so forth).
